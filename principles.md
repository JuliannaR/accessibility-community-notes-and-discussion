# Accessibility principles

This is a draft document

## 1. Accessibility has been thought of throughout the service lifecycle

Accessibility has been a core design principle from requirements gathering and procurement through to launch and beyond.

Poor choices made early in the production lifecycle can damage or even prevent a service from being accessible.

If part of a service is procured from a third party whose solution is inaccessible, the overall accessibility of the service can be affected.

## 2. Accessibility has been thought of across the entire service

Accessibility has been considered across both online and offline components of the service.

Not everyone can access digital services. Choices of alternative ways to engage with a service, like the phone or in person, are important to the overall accessibility of the service.

## 3. Accessibility is a shared responsibility

Accessibility is the responsibility of everyone who works on a service.

Choices made by UX researchers, designers, developers and content producers can inadvertently introduce accessibility problems. If product owners, delivery managers and procurement teams do not consider accessibility throughout the production lifecycle it will affect the overall accessibility of the service.

## 4. The service is simple

We have done the hard work so our users don't have to.

Choosing complex platforms and technologies can make it harder for services to be accessible. Creating complex interactions makes it harder for people to use the service.

## 5. Services are usable

Services are used by people in different environments, and using different technologies.

People who have cognitive, physical, hearing and/or visual disabilities access services in different ways. Assistive technologies like screen magnifiers, screen readers and speech recognition tools are often used by people with certain disabilities to access digital services.

People may also experience temporary disability due to environmental factors like bright sunshine making it harder to see a screen or background noise making it harder to hear, or transient conditions like a broken wrist making it impossible to use a mouse or a migraine making it harder to process content.


## 6. Services can be read and understood by everyone


Services use simple language, presented in a format that is comfortable to read.

Making content difficult to understand, or hard work to read, will affect the overall accessibility of the service. Short words and sentences, presented in an unfussy font and generous text size will help.
