# Accessibility Standard

This is a draft standard document. 

We want everyone to be able to use our services. This is the right thing to do, and it is also the [law in the UK](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/15/contents).

## Who is responsible for accessibility?

We are all responsible for accessibility. This includes:
* Product, service and delivery managers
* User researchers
* Content producers
* Designers
* Developers and testers


## Meeting the standard

Your service must meet this accessibility standard to pass the [service assessment](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-assessments/check-if-you-need-a-service-assessment).

There are two parts to this accessibility standard. You will need to provide evidence that your service meets both parts.

### Technical accessibility

Your service must meet Level AA of the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0](https://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag.php).


* [Meeting the technical accessibility requirement](technical.md)
* [Meeting the technical accessibility requirement (Alternative version)](technical-alt.md)

### Usable accessibility

Your service must be tested with disabled and older people throughout the different [phases of design](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/phases).

## Maintaining the standard

Your service must continue to meet this accessibility standard throughout its lifetime.
