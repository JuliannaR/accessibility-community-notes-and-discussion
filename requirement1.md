# Requirement 1: Technical accessibility

This is a draft document.

Your service must meet [Requirement 1: Technical accessibility](requirements.md).

## Meeting Requirement 1

Test your service for conformance with the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/).

WCAG 2.0 explains how to make websites accessible to disabled and older people. The guidelines are written by accessibility specialists and disabled people at the [W3C](https://w3.org/).

WCAG 2.0 has three conformance levels: Level A, Level AA, and Level AAA. Your service must meet WCAG 2.0 Level AA as a minimum.

 You should use a combination of automated testing tools and manual checks to test for conformance with WCAG 2.0. For best results start early and test often throughout the lifecycle of your service.
