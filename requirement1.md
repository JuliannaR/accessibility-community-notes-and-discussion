# Requirement 1: Technical accessibility

This is a draft document.

Your service must meet [Requirement 1: Technical accessibility](requirements.md).

## Meeting Requirement 1

Test your service for conformance with the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/).

WCAG 2.0 explains how to make websites accessible to disabled and older people. The guidelines are written by accessibility specialists and disabled people at the [W3C](https://w3.org/).

WCAG 2.0 has three conformance levels: Level A, Level AA, and Level AAA. Your service must meet WCAG 2.0 Level AA as a minimum.

## How to meet Requirement 1

For your service to meet this requirement it must be tested against all WCAG 2.0 Level A and Level AA Success Criteria (SC). If your service fails any Level A or Level AA SC, it cannot be said to meet this requirement.

To be confident that your service meets this requirement, we recommend using a combination of techniques, and doing so from the earliest opportunity.

### Automated tools

Use an automated tool. Developers can incorporate an automated tool into the build process or access it via a web interface.

An automated tool only checks a subset of all WCAG 2.0 SC, but it will rapidly uncover issues that can be resolved early in development.

### Manual checks

Carry out manual checks. Regularly check critical WCAG 2.0 SC as part of your development process.

Critical manual checks cover a bigger subset of WCAG 2.0 SC than an automated tool, and will uncover further issues that can be quickly resolved as development continues.

### Full assessment

Conduct a full WCAG 2.0 assessment. Assess your service against all WCAG 2.0 Level A and Level AA SC, and resolve all issues that are uncovered.

Conduct an assessment at least twice during the development process. An assessment early on will help uncover issues with your component library or early prototypes. An assessment later on will determine whether issues uncovered during the initial assessment have been resolved, and uncover any other issues that need to be addressed before your service is made available to the public or its intended audience.

If you do not have expertise in your team or department to conduct a full assessment, it is possible to work with one of the third party suppliers available from the Digital Marketplace.
