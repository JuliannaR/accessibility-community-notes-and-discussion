# Meeting the usable accessibility requirement

This is a draft document.
Your service must meet the [usable accessibility requirement](requirements.md).

## How do we do it?

We test our services with disabled and older people, and using different devices with assistive technologies.

It must be possible for people to use the service. This means they must be able to complete each step, and access all the information they need to successfully complete their goals.
