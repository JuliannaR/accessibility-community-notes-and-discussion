# Accessibility requirements

This is a draft document. 

We want everyone to be able to use our services. This is the right thing to do, and it is also the [law in the UK](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/15/contents).

## Responsibility

We are all responsible for accessibility. This includes:
* Product, service and delivery managers
* User researchers
* Content producers
* Designers
* Developers and testers

## Services

All our services must be accessible. This includes services used by the public (national and international), as well as services used by people working in government.

The prevalence of disability is higher than you might think. Around 17% of the general public has a disability, and around 9% of civil servants.

Note: a service must be accessible even if user research fails to identify disabled people as part of the target audience. People do not always self-identify as having a disability, so a failure to identify people with disabilities within a target audience does not mean they are not using the service.

## Requirements

There are three accessibility requirements. Your service must meet all of them by the time it becomes available to the public or its intended audience, and must continue to do so for as long as the service remains available.

### Requirement 1: Technical accessibility

Your service must meet Level AA of the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0](https://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag.php) as a minimum.

* [Requirement 1: Technical accessibility](requirement1.md)

### Requirement 2: AT compatibility

Your service must be compatible with common Assistive Technologies (AT), including screen magnifiers, screen readers and speech recognition tools.

* [Requirement 2: AT compatibility](requirement2.md)

### Requirement 3: Usable accessibility

Your service must be usable by disabled and older people, including people who use AT.

* [Requirement 3: Usable accessibility](requirement3.md)

## Exceptions

If you think that your service (or part of your service) cannot be made accessible, please contact the [accessibility team](accessibility-team@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk) to discuss it.
