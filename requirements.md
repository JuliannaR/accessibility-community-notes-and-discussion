# Accessibility requirements

This is a draft document. 

We want everyone to be able to use our services. This is the right thing to do, and it is also the [law in the UK](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/15/contents).

## Responsibility

We are all responsible for accessibility. This includes:
* Product, service and delivery managers
* User researchers
* Content producers
* Designers
* Developers and testers

## Services

All our services must be accessible. This includes services used by the public, as well as services used by people working in government.

Note: a service must be accessible even if user research fails to identify disabled people as part of the target audience. People do not always self-identify as having a disability, so a failure to identify people with disabilities within a target audience does not mean they are not using the service.

## Requirements

There are four accessibility requirements. You will need to provide evidence that your service meets all of them.

### Requirement 1: Technical accessibility

Your service must meet Level AA of the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0](https://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag.php) as a minimum.

* [Meeting the technical accessibility requirement](requirement1.md)
* [Meeting the technical accessibility requirement (alternate version)](requirement1-alt.md)

### Requirement 2: AT compatibility

Your service must be tested for compatibility with common Assistive Technologies (AT), including screen magnifiers, screen readers and speech recognition tools.

* [Meeting the AT compatibility requirement](requirement2.md)

### Requirement 3: Usability

Your service must be tested with disabled and older people throughout the different [phases of design](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/phases).

* [Meeting the usable accessibility requirement](requirement3.md)

## Requirement 4: Maintenance

Your service must continue to meet these accessibility requirements throughout its lifetime.

## Exceptions

If you think that a service (or part of a service) cannot be made accessible, please contact the [accessibility team](accessibility-team@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk) to discuss it.
