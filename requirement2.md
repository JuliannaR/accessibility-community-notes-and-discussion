# Requirement 2: AT compatibility

This is a draft document.

Your service must meet [Requirement 2: AT compatibility](requirements.md).

## Meeting Requirement 2

Test your service for compatibility with different Assistive Technologies (AT).
Note: your service must also be tested with disabled people who use AT, as part of [Requirement 3: Usability](requirement3.md).

## How to meet Requirement 2

We recommend testing with the following AT and browser combinations. Research conducted in 2016 identified these combinations as the most commonly used across Gov.UK.

Note: if no version numbers are indicated for the AT or browser, the latest version should be used.

* Jaws 15, 16 or 17.
* ZoomText.
* Read and Write.
* Dragon Naturally Speaking 11.
