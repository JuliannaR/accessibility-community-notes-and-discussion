# Meeting Requirement 2: AT compatibility

This is a draft document.

Your service must meet [Requirement 2: AT compatibility](requirements.md).

## How to meet Requirement 2

We test our services with different Assistive Technologies (AT).

Note: services must also be tested for [usability](usability-requirement.md) with people who use ATs.

### What do we need to do?

We recommend testing with the following AT and browser combinations. Research conducted in 2016 identified these combinations as the most commonly used across Gov.UK.

Note: if no version numbers are indicated for the AT or browser, the latest version should be used.
