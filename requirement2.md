# Requirement 2: AT compatibility

This is a draft document.

Your service must meet [Requirement 2: AT compatibility](requirements.md).

## Meeting Requirement 2

Test your service for compatibility with different Assistive Technologies (AT).

Note: your service must also be tested with disabled people who use AT, as part of [Requirement 3: Usable accessibility](requirement3.md).

## How to meet Requirement 2

To be confident that your service meets this requirement you should test with the following AT and browser combinations. Research conducted in 2016 identified these combinations as the most commonly used across Gov.UK.

Note: if no version numbers are indicated for the AT or browser, the latest version should be used.

Internet Explorer 11 with:
* Jaws 15, 16 or 17.
* ZoomText.
* Read and Write.
* Dragon Naturally Speaking 11.

Firefox with:
* NVDA.

Safari with:
* VoiceOver (iOS9).
* VoiceOver (MacOS Sierra).


It is not always possible to make every feature of a service work perfectly with every AT and browser combination.

If you discover an issue you should first make sure that the problem is not caused by features in your service that do not follow accessibility best practice, or by a known issue with the AT or browser in question.

If you are unsure how to resolve an issue, we recommend joining the [Cross-Government Accessibility community](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/communities/accessibility-community) and asking for help.

Features should be tested for AT compatibility before they are considered complete.
