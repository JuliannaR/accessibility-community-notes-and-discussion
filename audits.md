# Getting an audit

This is a draft document.

An accessibility audit is an assessment of a website or product against a recognised set of criteria. We use the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 to audit our services.

* [Understanding WCAG 2.0](wcag.md)
* [Understanding WCAG 2.0 (alternate)](wcag-alt.md)

An accessibility audit does two things:

1. Identifies accessibility issues with your service;
2. Confirms that you have fixed those issues.

If you have accessibility expertise within your department you can carry out an accessibility audit on your own service. Otherwise you can work with a third party to get an accessibility audit done.

## When to get an audit

You should have an accessibility audit carried out at different points in the lifecycle of your service. This will help you identify and resolve issues in a timely and cost effective way, and give you greater confidence that your service meets [Requirement 1: Technical accessibility](requirement1.md).

### Early audit

If you use a design pattern library you should get it audited for accessibility before you begin deploying the patterns throughout your service. Identifying and resolving accessibility issues in your design pattern library will make sure that the building blocks of your service have good accessibility.

If you do not use a design pattern library, an accessibility audit of your service prototype will help identify accessibility issues that will need resolving as the service moves into proper development.

### Later audit

You should get your service audited for accessibility again before it is made available to its intended audience. This will help make sure that your service has good technical accessibility by the time people start to use it for the first time.

## Getting an audit

You should use the Digital Marketplace to find an agency to carry out your accessibility audits.

Editor's note: does anyone know how the Digital marketplace works? Would be good to include some umore useful info here.

### Writing a brief

You will need to write a project brief. The brief should include the following details:

* The name of your service and a brief description of its purpose;
* The approximate number of design patterns, unique page types or unique types of content your service uses;
* The types of deliverables you want to receive;
* The Guidelines you want your service audited against (WCAG 2.0 Level A and Level AA);
* The components you want included in the audit.

### Picking a supplier

Editor's note: could do with some suggestions for this bit.

## What to ask for

An accessibility audit can include different components.

### Conformance testing

Conformance testing is the basic component of every audit. It is the assessment of your service against WCAG 2.0, specifically against all Level A and Level AA Success Criteria (SC).

### AT compatibility testing

Assistive Technology (AT) testing assesses your service for compatibility with screen magnifiers, speech recognition tools and screen readers. This directly relates to [Requirement 2: AT compatibility testing](requirement2.md).

### Expert review

An expert review is carried out by a panel of experienced testers who have disabilities. It assesses the experience of using your service, but should not be confused with usability testing with people from your target audience.

Editor's note: does this difference need more explanation?

### Retest

A retest is a second round of conformance testing. It is intended to confirm that the issues identified during the initial conformance test (and other types of testing), have been successfully resolved.

## What to expect

An accessibility audit can result in different deliverables. It is a good idea to ask prospective agencies for examples of their deliverables, so you can make an informed decision about which will be most useful to your team.

### Results

This is the set of results from the conformance testing part of an audit. Often presented in spreadsheet form, the results give you a high level overview of the pass/fail status for each SC across the test sample.


### Report

This is a written (often very long) document. It describes different issues, explains why they are important, and provides solutions (including code examples) for resolving them.

### Tickets

This Is when the agency creates individual issue tracking tickets, either in your preferred issue tracker or via one of their own. Tickets describe individual issues and provide solutions (including code examples).

Editor's note: I feel we need to include guidance on the pros/cons of different deliverables - but realise I have no idea what the typical deliverables from agencies on the DM look like. Can we ask them to send us samples perhaps?

## What to audit

When you have your design pattern library audited for accessibility, it is a good idea to include all the paterns in the library. The patterns will be the building blocks of your entire service, so having the whole library assessed is a good investment.


It is not practical (or even necessary) to assess every page (or step) across an entire service though. Instead the approach is to identify a sample that is a reasonably diverse representation of the different types of page and content.

Editor's note: I think DAC have come up with a good methodology for this. Can we use it here?


One of the things to look out for in the agency you choose, is whether they can confidently help you identify the test sample.

## Using the audit results

* Using the deliverables
* Getting a retest
