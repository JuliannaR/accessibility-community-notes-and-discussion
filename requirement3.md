# Requirement 3: Usability

This is a draft document.

Your service must meet [Requirement 3: Usability](requirements.md].

## Meeting Requirement 3

Test your service with disabled and older people, including people who use Assistive Technologies (AT).

It must be possible for people to use the service. This means they must be able to complete each step, and access all the information they need to complete their goals in a reasonable amount of time.

## How to meet Requirement 3


To be confident that your service meets this requirement it must have been tested with disabled and older people from your target audience, or have been reviewed by disabled and older people who are experienced testers.

The ideal way to meet this requirement is to include disabled and older people in your usability testing. Users should have a genuine need to use your service, and should include representatives from the following categories:

* blind and visually impaired (and can include those with low vision, detached retina, glaucoma, cataracts, stroke related eye condition, accident or injury related poor vision, age related poor vision)
* Deaf and hard of hearing 
* cognitive disabilities (and can include those with Aspergers, Autistic Spectrum, Dyslexia, Dyspraxia, Dyscalculia, ADHD)
* motor disabilities
* mental health
* 60 years and over

You should include multiple users from each category. Making design choices based on feedback from a single user in any given category is a risky prospect.

A review of your service by disabled and older people who are experienced testers will include users from each of the categories mentioned above. It will not provide insights from the point of view of older and disabled people from your target audience, but it will provide general insights and recommendations for resolving any problems.

Best idea is to do expert review, then validate with usability testing.
