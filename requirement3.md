# Requirement 3: Usable accessibility

This is a draft document.

Your service must meet [Requirement 3: Usable accessibility](requirements.md).

## Meeting Requirement 3

Your service must be usable by disabled and older people, including people who use Assistive Technologies (AT).

It must be possible for people to use the service. This means they must be able to complete each step, and access all the information they need to complete their goals in a reasonable amount of time.

## How to meet Requirement 3

To meet this requirement your service must have been tested with disabled and older people from your target audience, or reviewed by disabled and older people who are experienced testers.

### Usability testing

To be confident that your service meets this requirement you should include older and disabled people in your usability testing. Users should have a genuine need to use your service, and should include representatives from the following categories:

* Blind and partially sighted (including people with low vision, Glaucoma, de-tattched retinas, Diabetic Retinopathy, Macular Degeneration, cataracts, age or accident related eye problems);
* Deaf and hard of hearing (including people who have BSL as a first language, age or accident related hearing problems);
* Cognitive (including people on the Autistic Spectrum, with Dyslexia, Asperger's Syndrome, ADHD, Dyspraxia or Dyscalculia);
* Mobility (including people with poor motor control, missing or unusable limbs that affect use of technology, quadriplegia, Multiple Sclerosis, or Motor Neurone Disease);
* Mental health (including people with Bi-polar Disorder, Depression or sleep disorders that affect day to day activities);
* Age 60 and over.

Validate findings with multiple users from each category. Making design choices based on feedback from a single user in any category is poor practice.

### Expert review

For even greater confidence that your service meets this requirement, have your service reviewed by disabled and older people who are experienced testers. 

An expert review will not provide feedback from users in your target audience, but it will provide general feedback from older and disabled users. It will also give you recommended solutions for resolving any issues that are uncovered.

If you do not have expertise in your team or department to conduct usability testing, or do not have a panel of disabled and older people who can conduct an expert review, it is possible to work with one of the third party suppliers available from the Digital Marketplace.
