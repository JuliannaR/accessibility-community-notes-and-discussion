# Why our services are accessible

## Responsibility
We make our services accessible because everyone who needs to interact with the UK Government must be able to do so. This includes people with cognitive, hearing, physical and visual disabilities, as well as age related impairments.

## Legislation
We have a legal responsibility to make our services accessible. The UK Equality Act (2010) requires that all services are accessible to people with disabilities.

## Usability
We make our services accessible because it makes them easier for everyone. Accessible services are easier to read, easier to understand, and easier to use across a range of different devices.

## Efficiency
We think about accessibility throughout the service lifecycle because it is more efficient than bolting it on at the end. Considering it from prototyping onwards increases the quality of accessibility, and removes the cost of remediation later on.

## Culture
We take pride in making our services accessible because it is what we do. It is our culture to do our jobs to the best of our abilities, and accessibility is simply one of the many things we believe are essential to delivering our services.
